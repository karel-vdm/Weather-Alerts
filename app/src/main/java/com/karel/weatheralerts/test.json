Moderate to heavy smoke is possible\nearly Tuesday morning from the fire, southward along County Road\n730 to Gunnison. Smoke in these areas should decrease by late\nTuesday morning as atmospheric mixing increases.

This is especially true for those with heart disease,\nrespiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider\nlimiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.\nConsider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is\nmaking you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in\nyour neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.",

        "description": "***LONG ISLAND SOUND DEBRIS FIELD***\n\nAttention all mariners in the Long Island Sound area. The National\nWeather Service in coordination with the United States Coast Guard\ncontinue to receive reports of debris across Long Island Sound,\ncaused by recent flooding across New England. This will create some\nhazards for boaters, swimmers, and watercraft in the affected area.\n\nAt this time reports of the debris consist mainly of logs, which\nhave been washing ashore. The debris may not be easily visible.\nBoaters should exercise caution and be mindful of the debris. We\nencourage everyone to make responsible decisions when engaging in\nwater activities in the Long Island Sound.\n\nPlease stay updated with local weather reports and official\nannouncements for any further information. Your safety is important\nto us. Share this information with fellow mariners and water\nenthusiasts to ensure awareness of the debris flow in the Long\nIsland Sound.\n\nStay safe and informed.",

With another, potentially\nheavier round over parts of southern Illinois and western Kentucky\nWednesday night. Daily thunderstorm chances then persist until a\nlarger scale storm system approaches from the west on Sunday.\n\nThunderstorms are forecast to move from northwest to southeast\nparticularly through Wednesday morning, potentially training over\nthe same areas which would lead to significant rainfall totals.\nAreas across southeast Missouri are drier and would be able to\nhandle more rain without flooding, but may still see enough rain\nto cause flooding. Areas of southern Illinois and western\nKentucky as well as southwest Indiana have seen much heavier\nrecent rainfall and would be vulnerable to flash flooding.\n\nAreas that experienced historic flooding recently may also have\ndebris/trees/brush in creeks and streams that may back up drainage\nsystem and cause water to rise faster than it normally would.\nCitizens and communities are encouraged to clear storm drainage\nsystems ahead of the arrival of this system. Maintain awareness of\nthe potential threat and check back for updates. Flash flood\nwatches will almost certainly be issued in the coming days,\npossibly across the entire area in the hours preceding flood\nrisk. The timing, placement, and magnitude of each day's event\nshould get clearer as each day evolves.",

The National\nWeather Service in coordination with the United States Coast Guard\ncontinue to receive reports of debris across Long Island Sound,\ncaused by recent flooding across New England. This will create some\nhazards for boaters, swimmers, and watercraft in the affected area.\n\nAt this time reports of the debris consist mainly of logs, which\nhave been washing ashore. The debris may not be easily visible.\nBoaters should exercise caution and be mindful of the debris. We\nencourage everyone to make responsible decisions when engaging in\nwater activities in the Long Island Sound.\n\nPlease stay updated with local weather reports and official\nannouncements for any further information. Your safety is important\nto us. Share this information with fellow mariners and water\nenthusiasts to ensure awareness of the debris flow in the Long\nIsland Sound.\n\nStay safe and informed.",

The National\nWeather Service in coordination with the United States Coast Guard\ncontinue to receive reports of debris across Long Island Sound,\ncaused by recent flooding across New England. This will create some\nhazards for boaters, swimmers, and watercraft in the affected area.\n\nAt this time reports of the debris consist mainly of logs, which\nhave been washing ashore. The debris may not be easily visible.\nBoaters should exercise caution and be mindful of the debris. We\nencourage everyone to make responsible decisions when engaging in\nwater activities in the Long Island Sound.\n\nPlease stay updated with local weather reports and official\nannouncements for any further information. Your safety is important\nto us. Share this information with fellow mariners and water\nenthusiasts to ensure awareness of the debris flow in the Long\nIsland Sound.\n\nStay safe and informed.",
